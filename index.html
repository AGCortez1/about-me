    <p>Hello my name is Benjamin Rude! I am 33 years old and finally making moves again to get into the tech industry after a failed attempt years ago due to unforseen life happenings, and then breaking my body down with physical driving jobs. Enjoy playing games of almost anykind and my it feels like I have a thousand interests and no money to really look into them so I try and narrow it down to a few things.</p>

    <p>For my education I graduated from Bonney Lake High School in 2008. I have some college credits. Have credits for two years worth of classes from Full Sail University when I went for a bachelors degree in Game Design. So years ago I had "some" experience with unity and C++ but that knowledge has left my body at some point in the following years. I did however take extra course before I left, and got a certificate for work in media in communications. I would consider myself a laymen still in that field, but its just extra knowledge I have learned and been able to apply into other areas.</p>

    <p>Have over 10 years of customer service experience. A good chunk of that was when I worked security in a variety of roles in Bellevue... shift lead, patrol officer, dock master for an Amazon building. Roughly 3 years of route driving. Half of it I was a service technician for commercial dishwashers, and then I worked for Shred-It collecting confidential information for destruction which was very security and customer focused as well. In both cases I took on routes that needed to be turned around by a consistent driver.</p>

    <p>Currently my goal is to just learn. This is going to be tough, but I know I can do it. Stretch goals will be added once I start feeling comfortable with my education.</p>
